# moodle_file_restrictor

This Moodle plugin will allow you to restrict certain file extensions from being uploaded into Moodle, and allowing others. It comes in handy when the space allocated to your Moodle site by your hosting is not much, like our case. We only allow images to be uploaded.

The plugin has a settings page under the local section so that the restricted and allowed file extensions can be set.
